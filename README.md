# hackyscripts
Unprofessional but useful scripts, mostly Linux/Bash/Perl. These scripts are Public Domain and are also licenced under MIT.

These scripts are not suitable for production use, they are not widely used nor comprehensively tested. They might accidentally destroy your data. Take backups before using them!

However you might find them useful, either as-is, or as the basis or inspiration for your own customisations or re-writes.
